<h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3>

  You can add a formatting to strings by appending it right after. They start with the symbol `%`.

  You can do many things with formatting:
  - Tranformation: `%:funcToApply` applies the given function to the string
  - Whole string trimming: `%s`, add an `x` before or after to specify position. Ex: `%xsx` trims both ends of the string.
  - Line trimming: `%l`, add an `x` before or after to specify position. Ex: `%xl` trims the beginning of every line.
  - Indent trimming: `%i`, same as line trimming, but keeps the nested indentation.
  
  Formatting nomenclature:

  i: indent (trim, but keep indentation, check for least amount of spaces before, than trim, spaces and tabs not allowed combined, never with s (string))
  t: tab
  _: space
  j: join (must be at the end of the format. joins all lines with the character after if any, or nothing if ends with j)

  // Explicit characters like \t and \n are not trimmed.
  ""%xs // Trim empty lines at the beginning of the string
  ""%xsx // Trim empty lines at the beginning and the end of the string
  ""%sx // Trim empty lines at the end of the string
  ""%xl // Trim everyline before
  ""%xlx // Trim everyline before and after
  ""%lx // Trim everyline after
  ""%xs%xt // Trim at the beginning of the string and the end of every line
  ""%xl%sx // Trim at the beginning of every line and the end of the string
  ""%i__ // Keep indentation at the beginning of everyline starting with two spaces

  let description = "This is a text description
                     on many lines. It stays many
                     lines but trims beginning.
                    "%xlsx

  let singleLine = "This is written on multiple
                    lines but will all be joined
                    on a single line.
                    "%xlx%j_

  Maybe allow formatting after scripts too? <html></html>%xs

  ### Default string format

  I think I want the default format to be %i%xsx.

  You can use the keyword `use` to set a default format for the strings that comes after in the current scope.

  ```jome
  use %xlx%j_
  let str = "some multi
             line string" // will use the format above
  ```

  The formats do not add up to each other. When you specify a format, it replaces the previous one.

  Maybe allow to give names to format that you can reuse?

  Or simply numbers?

  set format 0 %xlx%j_

  then you do "some string"%0

  When there is a default format and you want none, use only % like "str"%

  Maybe define single digits aliases myself to be the most commonly used formats. This way you can know what it means without looking
  it up if you are an expert.

  Or maybe define named aliases myself.

  %_html => string like in html, joins the lines with a single space

  Maybe it would be nice if I could modify only some flag instead of all. Let's say, I always want xsx, but only sometimes xl,
  I don't want to have to redefine xsx every time.

  Peut-être quand dans le fond faire que ce sont tous des flags.

  Tu peux faire %s pour reset string settings, %l pour line settings, %s%l%i%j équivalerais à % qui reset tout

  Je ne sais pas pour %i par contre, mais celui n'est pas encore tout à fais clair. Ça garde juste le nested indent?

  Si %i active, comment désactivé?
