# Jome language reference

Jome is code that is inserted into other languages in order to add more information or give more advanced features.

Jome uses the extension of the base language and is added in the shape of a comment.

## FIXME: Lifecycles

When are the scripts called and updated? How is this handled?

## Syntax

Jome files should have a header with a version as a first or second line (after sha-bang) to identify them as such.

Ex: `<!--jome 0.0.1-->`

## Comments

Comments are inserted using a whitespace after the comment beginning block.

Markdown and HTML can be used to show stuff.

## Scripts

You can add scripts inside for example an html file to generate html code.

WHEN WILL THE SCRIPT BE CALLED???

## Inputs

## Code

Blocks of code that can be executed to show like in Jupyter.

## Navbar & Sidebar

It would be very nice to allow a navbar and/or a sidebar in the document. With HTML inside mardown file is possible? Is there limitations to HTML inside markdown like on github? Most probably for security measures.
